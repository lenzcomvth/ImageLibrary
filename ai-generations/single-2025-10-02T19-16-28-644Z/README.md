A voluminous and flowing traditional Chinese Hanfu dress in rich teal and jade green, adorned with intricate gold floral and vine-like embroidery patterns across the fabric. A magnificent gold ornate crown/hairpiece sits atop her high bun. She firmly holds a long, polished silver-colored sword across her body. Golden autumn leaves and petals are gracefully falling around her and scattered on the stone ground. Branches with delicate golden flowers and leaves are visible near her. A high-angle, medium shot looking down at the subject in a dynamic pose on an ancient Chinese stone-paved street or courtyard. Traditional Chinese buildings with dark tiled roofs, red pillars, and glowing orange lanterns line the background, slightly blurred with a beautiful bokeh effect. Warm, soft natural light, possibly golden hour, illuminating her from the top-right, creating subtle highlights on her hair, skin, and the flowing fabric, casting soft shadows. Ethereal, elegant, historical fantasy, Wuxia film aesthetic, fashion photography, cinematic drama, intricate detail.`
